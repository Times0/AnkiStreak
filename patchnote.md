## Ideas for improving the farming system
- Have a plant health bar. If you don't water the plant, it will die. If you don't harvest the plant, it will die.

Let me know if you have any ideas for improving the farming system.

## Bugs fixed
- Fixed a bug where the game would slow down when you zoom in and out of the map.
